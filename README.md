## Welcome!

### About Me

Hi there! My name is Kayleigh Young and I'm a senior at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. I'm originally from Northern New Jersey and have been an athlete my entire life. From competitive dance to volleyball and tennis, I have always been an active person. These days you can find me at the nearest hiking trail or rock climbing gym. 

I'm an integrative informatics major with a focus in art and media, and a psychology and communication arts double minor. I am particularly interested in researching the cultural relationship between art and science.

### Experience and Projects

**Professional Photography and Videography**\
I have been working as a professional photographer and videographer for 6 years, frequently shooting parties and weddings. Therefore I am highly accustomed to long  days and working with a variety of high end video and audio equipment. Despite the high stakes and high pressure position, I always loved being a part of documenting a client's special day.

**Cochranton Documentary**\
During my junior year of college I was contracted alongside a few other production students to create a documentary film for the brand new pharmacy in nearby Cochranton, PA. I was heavily involved in the shooting and editing of this project.

**Senior Comprehensive Project**\
My year long senior comprehensive project is a documentary film exploring the scientific and cultural implications of CRISPR.
