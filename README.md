## Welcome!

### About Me

Hi there! My name is Kayleigh Young and I'm a senior at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. I'm originally from Northern New Jersey and have been an athlete my entire life. From competitive dance to volleyball and tennis, I have always been an active person. These days you can find me at the nearest hiking trail or rock climbing gym.

I'm an integrative informatics major with a focus in art and media, and a psychology and communication arts double minor. I am particularly interested in researching the cultural relationship between art and science.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kayleighayoung/kayleighyoung/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
