## About Me

I’m an artist and researcher with a lot of unique interdisciplinary experience currently earning a Bachelor of Science in Integrative Informatics from Allegheny College. I have studied art, computer science, and psychology during my time as an undergraduate student, and I have eight years of experience in professional settings and six as a professional photographer and videographer. 

### Skills

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kayleighayoung/kayleighyoung.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
